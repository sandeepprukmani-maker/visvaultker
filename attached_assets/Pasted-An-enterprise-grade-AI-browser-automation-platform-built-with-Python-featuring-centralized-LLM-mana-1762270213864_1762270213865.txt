An enterprise-grade AI browser automation platform built with Python, featuring centralized LLM management, multi-modal intelligence, task teaching system, and intelligent workflow orchestration
I'll include the following features:

Centralized LLM module (llm_manager.py) - single unified interface for all AI model interactions with automatic provider routing
Configuration-based model management - all model names, API endpoints, capabilities, and preferences stored in config.yaml/config.json
Multi-LLM intelligence hub supporting GPT-4, GPT-4 Vision, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude Vision, and Gemini with automatic model selection based on task complexity
Smart model selector - automatically chooses best model based on task type (vision tasks → GPT-4V/Claude Vision, reasoning → Claude, speed → GPT-4)
Unified API interface - single method call works across all providers with automatic parameter translation
Model fallback system - if primary model fails, automatically tries alternative models from config
Advanced natural language understanding that interprets complex, multi-step automation requests with contextual awareness
Intelligent website profiling engine with deep interactive exploration using Playwright - hovers, clicks, scrolls to discover all hidden elements, modals, and conditional UI
Visual AI analysis using vision models to understand page layouts, identify elements visually, and detect UI patterns
Self-learning DOM mapper that builds comprehensive element graphs, interaction trees, and state-based UI maps
Semantic understanding system that categorizes elements by function, filters dynamic content, and learns element relationships
Autonomous exploration mode with safe interaction engine - intelligently clicks, hovers, and navigates while avoiding destructive actions
Task teaching system - demonstrate tasks once, AI learns and stores them as reusable automations with natural language names
Taught task library with categorization, tagging, search, and version control for all learned automations
Single task execution - run any taught task on demand with simple prompts like 'Run LinkedIn connection task'
Intelligent workflow builder - chain multiple taught tasks into sequential or conditional workflows using natural language
Workflow orchestration engine with parallel execution, conditional branching, loops, and error handling between tasks
Smart data passing between chained tasks - output from one task becomes input for the next automatically
Visual workflow designer showing task dependencies, execution flow, and data flow between steps
Workflow templates - save and reuse complex task chains like 'Scrape product data → Compare prices → Send email report'
Context-aware automation executor that adapts to website changes, handles errors intelligently, and self-corrects during execution
Advanced browser control with Playwright featuring anti-detection, session persistence, cookie management, and stealth mode
Real-time execution dashboard with live browser preview, AI reasoning display, step-by-step progress for individual tasks and entire workflows
Intelligent retry logic with multiple fallback strategies - visual fallback, AI-suggested alternatives, and pattern matching
Profile versioning system that tracks website UI changes over time and auto-updates learned profiles
Smart template library with AI-generated automation scripts for common platforms - LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, e-commerce sites
Natural language query interface for asking questions about learned websites and taught tasks
Workflow intelligence that learns from successful automations and suggests task combinations and optimizations
Parametric tasks - teach tasks with variables that can be filled in at runtime (e.g., 'Send message to {name} on LinkedIn')
Batch execution mode - run a single task or workflow multiple times with different inputs from CSV or JSON
Multi-modal output generation - screenshots with annotations, structured data exports, visual reports, and execution videos
SQLAlchemy ORM with PostgreSQL database for persistent storage of website profiles, taught tasks, workflows, interaction graphs, and execution history
Task scheduling with APScheduler and Celery for queue management with priority handling, concurrent execution limits, and dependency chains
Comprehensive monitoring with execution analytics, success rate tracking, performance metrics, AI confidence scores, and model usage statistics
