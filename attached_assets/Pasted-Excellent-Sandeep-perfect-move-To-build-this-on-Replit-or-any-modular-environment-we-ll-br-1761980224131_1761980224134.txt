Excellent, Sandeep — perfect move 👏

To build this on Replit (or any modular environment), we’ll break it into clear, incremental phases — each phase being a working milestone you can test independently before chaining them together.

This way, you (and Replit’s AI agent) can iteratively develop, debug, and scale each component step by step.


---

🧩 Full Project Roadmap — Broken Into Replit-Friendly Phases

Each phase is self-contained with its own purpose, deliverables, input/output, and dependencies.


---

🔹 Phase 1 — Core Setup and Environment

Goal: Get the base environment, dependencies, and structure ready.

Deliverables:

Project structure

Dependency installation

Environment variables for OpenAI and DB keys

Config management


Tasks:

1. Create folders:

/src
  /crawler
  /embeddings
  /templates
  /planner
  /executor
  /api
/data


2. Install dependencies:

pip install playwright openai chromadb fastapi uvicorn
playwright install chromium


3. Create .env file with:

OPENAI_API_KEY=
VECTOR_DB_PATH=./data/vector_db


4. Implement config.py to load env variables safely.



✅ Test: Run a “Hello World” FastAPI + Playwright test page open.


---

🔹 Phase 2 — Web Crawler and DOM Extractor

Goal: Automatically visit a URL and extract structural DOM + metadata.

Deliverables:

Playwright-based crawler

Structural DOM extractor (removes text)

JSON output of DOM tree + metadata + screenshot


Files:

src/crawler/crawler.py


Main functions:

crawl_url(url: str, depth: int = 1) -> List[dict]
extract_dom_structure(page) -> dict

Output Example:

{
  "url": "https://example.com/users?page=1",
  "structure_hash": "sha256...",
  "dom_structure": "<div><table>...</table></div>",
  "screenshot": "./data/screenshots/page1.png"
}

✅ Test:
Provide one URL → prints extracted structure + screenshot saved locally.


---

🔹 Phase 3 — Template Detection & Layout Similarity

Goal: Identify unique page templates and avoid duplicates (like pagination).

Deliverables:

Structural hash generator

Layout similarity check

Template registry in local JSON or DB


Files:

src/templates/template_detector.py


Functions:

detect_template(dom_structure: str) -> str  # returns template_id
calculate_similarity(structure1, structure2) -> float

Logic:

Normalize DOM (strip text)

Generate hash or vector

Compare against known templates
→ if similar ≥ 0.95 → reuse template
→ else → store as new


✅ Test:
Run crawler on page1 and page2 of a paginated table → only 1 template detected.


---

🔹 Phase 4 — Semantic Embeddings & Vector DB Index

Goal: Convert templates + elements into embeddings for semantic search.

Deliverables:

Embedding generator using OpenAI

Local vector database (Chroma or Pinecone)


Files:

src/embeddings/embedder.py


Functions:

generate_embedding(text: str) -> list
index_element(template_id, element_desc, vector)
search_similar_elements(query, top_k=5)

Process:

For each unique template, extract meaningful element descriptions

Store embeddings + metadata in Chroma


✅ Test:
Run: “Search for login button” → returns similar element descriptions.


---

🔹 Phase 5 — Semantic Labeling via GPT

Goal: Understand each template semantically (Login page, User list, etc.)

Deliverables:

GPT-powered labeler that classifies and describes elements.


Files:

src/embeddings/semantic_labeler.py


Functions:

label_template(dom_structure) -> dict

Prompt Example:

Given this DOM, identify page type and describe its components.
Return JSON: { "page_type": "...", "components": {...} }

✅ Test:
Feed DOM → prints JSON with semantic understanding.


---

🔹 Phase 6 — RAG Context Retriever

Goal: Fetch relevant UI elements and templates for a user’s natural-language command.

Deliverables:

Query → Vector DB search → Context fetcher


Files:

src/planner/context_retriever.py


Functions:

retrieve_context(query: str, app_id: str) -> List[dict]

✅ Test:
Input: “Find button to download report”
→ Output: Top 5 element candidates with selector & description.


---

🔹 Phase 7 — GPT Action Planner

Goal: Generate automation plan (sequence of actions) from user query + context.

Deliverables:

GPT planner prompt

JSON output of automation steps


Files:

src/planner/action_planner.py


Prompt Example:

Task: "Login and go to user list"
Context: [list of relevant elements with selectors]
Return JSON list of actions (navigate, click, input, wait)

✅ Test:
Feed query → see structured JSON plan.


---

🔹 Phase 8 — Executor (Playwright Automation Runner)

Goal: Execute GPT-generated JSON plan using Playwright.

Deliverables:

Executor that reads JSON and performs actions

Logging of results and screenshots


Files:

src/executor/runner.py


Functions:

execute_plan(plan: List[dict]) -> dict

✅ Test:
Run GPT plan → performs live browser automation → screenshot each step.


---

🔹 Phase 9 — Self-Healing Mechanism

Goal: Handle broken locators by finding semantic equivalents.

Deliverables:

Vector search for similar elements

GPT verification for equivalence

Confidence scoring system


Files:

src/executor/self_healer.py


Functions:

heal_broken_locator(old_desc, current_dom) -> dict

✅ Test:
Break an element ID manually → run automation → verify that self-healing finds and fixes it.


---

🔹 Phase 10 — Versioned Crawls and Change Detection

Goal: Track evolving UIs and detect added/removed/changed templates.

Deliverables:

Crawl version comparison system

Change detection and diff reporting


Files:

src/templates/version_tracker.py


Functions:

compare_versions(old, new) -> List[dict]

✅ Test:
Run crawl twice (before and after UI change) → show changed elements.


---

🔹 Phase 11 — FastAPI Backend & Dashboard

Goal: Expose APIs for crawl, search, run, heal, and visualize results.

Deliverables:

REST API endpoints for all core functions

Optional simple dashboard (Streamlit or HTML)


Files:

src/api/main.py


Endpoints:

POST /crawl
POST /run
GET /templates
GET /changes

✅ Test:
Hit /crawl → triggers crawler and returns templates.


---

🔹 Phase 12 — Continuous Learning and Auto Updates

Goal: Automatically update embeddings and templates when UI evolves.

Deliverables:

Scheduled crawler

Re-embedding only changed elements

Confidence-based auto-updates


Files:

src/scheduler/auto_update.py


✅ Test:
App changes → re-crawl detects & updates templates automatically.


---

🔹 Phase 13 — Monitoring, Logs, and Metrics

Goal: Add observability to monitor automation success and healing accuracy.

Deliverables:

Log file + database of run metrics

Optional visualization dashboard


✅ Metrics:

Crawl coverage

Template count

Success rate

Healing accuracy

False positive rate



---

🔹 Phase 14 — Optimization & Productionization

Goal: Scale, reduce cost, and harden security.

Deliverables:

Caching embeddings

Secure credential injection

Autoscaling Playwright workers

Encrypted storage

Environment separation (dev/stage/prod)



---

✅ Final Outcome

By Phase 14, you’ll have a self-learning, self-healing UI automation engine that can:

Understand any web app’s structure

Handle pagination + evolving UIs

Automate by natural language

Heal itself when locators break

Continuously adapt as the app changes

Would you like me to now generate the Phase 1 + 2 code scaffolding (Replit-ready) — so you can immediately run the crawler and DOM extractor? That’s the best starting point.
