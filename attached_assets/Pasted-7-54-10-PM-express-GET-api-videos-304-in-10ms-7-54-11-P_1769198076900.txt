Specifically, our daily rate index is down to 6.19% after starting the week at 6.21% on Tuesday (up from 6.07% last Friday).  While there was a large glut of seemingly important economic data today, it didn't have a noticeable impact on the bond market. Part of the reason is that the data in question is very stale at this point.&nbsp; The most recent monthly data covered November and the GDP release was for Q3 (July-Sep). Timeliness aside, the data was also very close to forecasts.  There's even less on the calendar tomorrow, but markets remain susceptible to geopolitical risk and any headlines that speak to the fiscal outlook (tariffs, spending, etc).&nbsp;","link":"https://www.mortgagenewsdaily.com/markets/mortgage-rates-01222026","pubDate":"Thu, 22 Jan 2026 20:40:00 GMT"}
