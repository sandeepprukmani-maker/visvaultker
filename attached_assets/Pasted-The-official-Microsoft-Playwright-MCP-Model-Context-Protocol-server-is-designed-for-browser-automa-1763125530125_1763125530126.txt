The official Microsoft Playwright MCP (Model Context Protocol) server is designed for browser automation using Playwright, enabling LLMs and automation tools to interact with web pages via structured accessibility snapshots rather than pixel-based inputs.

### How to Use the Official Playwright MCP Server from Microsoft

1. **Install and Run the MCP Server**
   The easiest way to run the Playwright MCP server is through `npx`:
   ```
   npx @playwright/mcp@latest --port 8931
   ```
   This command starts the MCP server on port 8931, ready to accept connections from clients.

2. **Configuration for MCP Clients**
   To connect a client to the MCP server, use this configuration snippet in your MCP client config file:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "playwright": {
         "url": "http://localhost:8931/mcp"
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   This tells the client to communicate with the local Playwright MCP server on the specified port.

3. **Capabilities and Options**
   The server supports several command-line options for browser type, headless mode, permissions, storage state, etc., such as:
   - `--browser chromium|firefox|webkit` (default: chromium)
   - `--headless` (run browser headless)
   - `--storage-state=<path>` (load a storage state file)
   - `--user-data-dir=<path>` (persistent user profile directory)
   - `--port <port>` (set listening port; default is localhost)

4. **Docker Support**
   There is an official Docker image for running the MCP server headlessly with Chromium:
   ```
   docker run -d -p 8931:8931 mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/mcp cli.js --headless --browser chromium --no-sandbox --port 8931
   ```
   This runs the MCP server as a container accessible on port 8931.

5. **Programmatic Usage**
   You can also embed the MCP server programmatically within a Node.js HTTP server using the MCP SDK for advanced custom use cases and transports like SSE.

### Summary Code to Run MCP Server on Local Machine

```bash
npx @playwright/mcp@latest --port 8931
```

And configure your MCP client with:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8931/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

This setup allows you to automate browsers remotely via the MCP protocol in a deterministic, structured way that's AI/LLM-friendly without relying on pixels/screenshots.
