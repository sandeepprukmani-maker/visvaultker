# Browser Automation Performance Guide

## Current Performance Optimizations

Your browser automation is configured for **BALANCED PERFORMANCE** - optimized for speed while maintaining reliability.

### ‚ö° Speed Improvements Applied

#### 1. **Optimized Wait Times** (40-50% faster than defaults)
- **Page Load Wait**: `0.5s` (default 1.0s)
- **Network Idle Wait**: `1.0s` (default 1.5s) 
- **Action Wait**: `0.5s` (default 1.0s)

**Impact**: Actions execute 40-50% faster while maintaining reliability on most websites

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: These settings work well for most sites but may need adjustment for:
- Heavy JavaScript frameworks (React, Angular, Vue)
- Sites with slow CDNs or cascading AJAX calls
- Authentication redirects or API-heavy dashboards
- Sites behind captive portals or with anti-bot protection

#### 2. **ChatBrowserUse Model** ‚úÖ ENABLED (3-5x faster)
- Using specialized browser automation model
- Optimized for browser tasks vs general OpenAI models
- Better task completion accuracy

#### 3. **Balanced Retry Mechanism**
- **Max Retries**: `3` (handles transient failures)
- **Initial Delay**: `1.0s`
- **Max Delay**: `30s`

**Impact**: Reliable failure recovery for network hiccups and rate limits

#### 4. **Appropriate Max Steps**
- **Max Steps**: `25` (good for most workflows)
- Adjust down to 15-20 for simple tasks, up to 30-40 for complex workflows

## Performance by Task Complexity

| Task Type | Expected Speed | Recommended Settings |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------|
| Simple (1-3 actions) | **5-10 seconds** | Current (Ultra-Fast) |
| Medium (4-8 actions) | **15-30 seconds** | Current (Ultra-Fast) |
| Complex (9+ actions) | **30-60 seconds** | Increase max_steps to 25-30 |
| Heavy JS sites | **May need tuning** | Increase network idle to 0.8s |

## üéØ When to Adjust Settings

### If you experience issues:

**Problem: Pages not loading completely**
```ini
# Increase network idle wait
wait_for_network_idle_page_load_time = 0.8  # from 0.5
```

**Problem: Actions failing intermittently**
```ini
# Increase action wait time
wait_between_actions = 0.3  # from 0.2
```

**Problem: Complex workflows timing out**
```ini
# Increase max steps
max_steps = 30  # from 20
```

**Problem: Heavy JavaScript websites**
```ini
# Increase all wait times by 2x
minimum_wait_page_load_time = 0.4
wait_for_network_idle_page_load_time = 1.0
wait_between_actions = 0.4
```

## üîß Manual Tuning Guide

### Conservative (Most Reliable)
```ini
minimum_wait_page_load_time = 1.0
wait_for_network_idle_page_load_time = 2.0
wait_between_actions = 1.0
max_steps = 30
```

### Balanced (Default)
```ini
minimum_wait_page_load_time = 0.5
wait_for_network_idle_page_load_time = 1.0
wait_between_actions = 0.5
max_steps = 25
```

### Fast (Current)
```ini
minimum_wait_page_load_time = 0.2
wait_for_network_idle_page_load_time = 0.5
wait_between_actions = 0.2
max_steps = 20
```

### Ultra-Fast (Experimental)
```ini
minimum_wait_page_load_time = 0.1
wait_for_network_idle_page_load_time = 0.3
wait_between_actions = 0.1
max_steps = 15
```
‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: Ultra-fast may cause instability on slow websites

## üìä Performance Monitoring

Check execution metrics in the response:
```json
{
  "performance_metrics": {
    "total_duration": "12.5s",
    "operations": {...}
  },
  "retry_stats": {
    "total_retries": 0,
    "success_rate": "100%"
  }
}
```

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **ChatBrowserUse is KEY**: Keep `use_chat_browser_use = true` for 3-5x speed boost
2. **Headless mode**: Always use `headless = true` in production (already enabled)
3. **Disable features you don't need**: Turn off screenshots/PDFs if not required
4. **Clear task instructions**: More precise instructions = fewer steps = faster execution
5. **Use the optimized engine**: The system defaults to optimized engine (good!)

## üöÄ Extreme Performance Mode

For **maximum speed** at the cost of some reliability:

```ini
[agent]
max_steps = 15

[browser_performance]
minimum_wait_page_load_time = 0.1
wait_for_network_idle_page_load_time = 0.3
wait_between_actions = 0.1

[retry]
max_retries = 1
initial_delay = 0.3

[advanced_features]
enable_screenshots = false
enable_pdf_generation = false
enable_state_persistence = false
track_detailed_metrics = false
```

Only use for simple, fast websites where speed is critical.

## üìù Configuration File Location

Edit: `config/config.ini`

After making changes, restart the application to apply them.
