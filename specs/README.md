# Playwright Test Agents - Test Plans

This directory contains test plans generated by the ðŸŽ­ Planner Agent.

## About Playwright Test Agents

Microsoft's Playwright Test Agents provide an AI-powered workflow for creating and maintaining test coverage:

1. **ðŸŽ­ Planner** - Explores your application and produces comprehensive test plans in Markdown format
2. **ðŸŽ¨ Generator** - Transforms test plans into executable Playwright Python tests  
3. **ðŸ”§ Healer** - Automatically repairs failing tests when the UI changes

## Directory Structure

```
workspace/
  specs/              # Test plans (this directory)
    basic-operations.md
    checkout-flow.md
  tests/              # Generated tests
    seed.spec.py      # Seed test for initialization
    test_*.py         # Generated test files
```

## Usage

### Create a Test Plan

Tell the Planner agent what you want to test:

```
"Generate a test plan for user registration"
```

The Planner will:
- Explore your application
- Identify scenarios to test
- Create a structured test plan in this directory

### Generate Tests

The Generator agent reads the test plan and creates executable tests:

```
"Generate tests from the registration plan"
```

The Generator will:
- Validate selectors against the live app
- Create production-ready Playwright tests
- Save them to the tests/ directory

### Heal Failing Tests

When tests fail due to UI changes, the Healer fixes them automatically:

```
"Heal the failing registration test"
```

The Healer will:
- Analyze the error
- Inspect the current UI
- Fix selectors and assertions
- Validate the fix works

## Application

- **Base URL**: http://localhost:5000
- **Initialized**: 1761629755.283808

## Next Steps

1. Review the seed test in `tests/seed.spec.py`
2. Use the Planner agent to create your first test plan
3. Generate tests with the Generator agent
4. Let the Healer fix any failures automatically

Happy testing! ðŸŽ­
