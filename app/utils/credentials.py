    Replace credential placeholders in the instruction with actual values.
    Also detect credential names mentioned in the instruction and inject URL, username, and password.
    
    Supports two modes:
    1. Placeholder format: {{credential_name}} - replaces with password only (legacy mode)
    2. Natural language: "log in to gmail" - injects URL, username, and password
